## Facebook Messenger-bot with NodeJS

We use NodeJS and restify framewok to build RESTful API. Before you can use this code, make sure you already has FB App, create FB Page and config Webhook.
In this case we create bot to ask first name of user then his/her birtdate and make calculation to show how many days left until his/her next birthday.

## Instalation

npm init

npm install restify request --save

after that you can just copy this code to your local environment.

```
git clone https://github.com/syaddadh1211/messenger-bot.git
```
